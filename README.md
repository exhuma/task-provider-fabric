# task-provider-fabric README

This extension provides VS-Code task executions for tasks defined using
"fabric" (https://fabfile.org).

This is currently in early alpha state. Baic tasks are already dicovered and
runnable but it has not yet been intensively tested.

TODO: finish docs (see initial commit in this repo for a README sample)
